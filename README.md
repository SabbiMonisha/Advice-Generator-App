## 🧵 Approach

1. **Understanding Requirements**  
   I reviewed the design guide and API behavior to understand the UI, responsiveness, and interactivity requirements.

2. **HTML Structure**  
   I created a semantic HTML layout for the advice card, text, divider, and button before adding styles.

3. **Styling with CSS**  
   I applied styles using the provided color palette and typography from the style guide.  
   Flexbox was used to center the card, and media queries were added for responsiveness.

4. **JavaScript & API Integration**  
   I integrated the Advice Slip API using `fetch()` to retrieve random advice.  
   Advice is shown on page load and updated dynamically on button click.

5. **Interactivity & Active States**  
   Hover states were added to the dice button to enhance user interaction and emphasize clickability.

6. **Version Control & Deployment**  
   The project was version-controlled using Git & GitHub.  
   Deployment was done through a static hosting provider to make the app publicly accessible.
